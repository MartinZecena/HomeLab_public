# HomeLab: Isolated Environment for Penetration Testing and Security Research
This is NOT a step by step guide but more like a reference architecture, its technical details and steps needed to create a HomeLab, how to do each step needs to be found on your own.
This HomeLab allows me to conduct IT-Security research by enabling experimentation with networks, tools and networking hardware.
The intention of my HomeLab is to provide me a flexible and unrestricted environment to help me practice, experiment, and test.
By building this setup, Im gaining hands-on experience with technologies and tools that I would not have access to in a virtual setting. This setup allows me to test tools, simulate attacks, monitor traffic, and much more.

## Purpose
* Create a safe and isolated environment for researching pentesting techniques. 
* Practice and apply networking concepts.
* Configure firewalls.
* Experiment with tools in a more controlled environment.
* Simulate a more real environment.
* Experiment with Network Hardware.
